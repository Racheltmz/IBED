    <!-- Speaker Info -->
    <section class="container speaker_info p-5">
        <p>His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk. He is the
            spiritual leader of Tibetans around the world. He was born on 6 July 1935, to a farming family, in a small
            hamlet located in Taktser, Amdo, northeastern Tibet. At the age of two, the child was recognized as the
            reincarnation of the previous 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso. His Holiness began his monastic education at
            the age of six. At 23, His Holiness sat for his final examination in Lhasaâ€™s Jokhang Temple, during the
            annual Great Prayer Festival (Monlam Chenmo) in 1959. He passed with honors and was awarded the Geshe
            Lharampa degree, equivalent to the highest doctorate in Buddhist philosophy. In 1989 he was awarded the
            Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent struggle for the liberation of Tibet. He has consistently advocated
            policies of non-violence, even in the face of extreme aggression. He also became the first Nobel Laureate to
            be recognized for his concern for global environmental problems. His Holiness has travelled to more than 67
            countries spanning 6 continents. He has received over 150 awards, honorary doctorates, prizes, etc., in
            recognition of his message of peace, non-violence, inter-religious understanding, universal responsibility
            and compassion. He has also authored or co-authored more than 110 books. His Holiness has held discussions
            with heads of different religions and participated in many events promoting inter-religious harmony and
            understanding. </p>
